1. Start SSMS
2. Create a new database, add a table and some sample records
	create database shoppingAPIDB

	use shoppingAPIDB

	create table Products
	(
		pId int primary key,
		pName varchar(20),
		pCategory varchar(20),
		pPrice int,
		pIsInStock bit
	)

	insert into Products values(101,'Pepsi','Cold-Drinks',50,1)
	insert into Products values(102,'Maggie','Fast-Food',50,1)
	insert into Products values(103,'Pasta','Fast-Food',50,1)

3. create a new WebAPI Application - shoppingWebAPI - EF

4. Build the application 

5. Add Nuget Packages from solution explorer 
	There are 4 nugets we need to be installed in a sequence
	right click solution explorer, manage nuget package, browse and enter Entityframeworkcore

	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

6. build the application

7. Go to tools -> Nuget Package Manager -> Nuget Package Manager Console
	fire the Scaffold-DBContext command

	Scaffold-DbContext "server=WIN8\NIKHILINSTANCE; database=shoppingAPIDB;integrated security=true" -OutputDir Models\EF -	Provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

	This will POCO classes for your application - POCO - Plain C# Objects 
	EF is based on ORM pattern - Object relational mapping


8. Build the applciation, check in the solution explorer, you  will get a folder - Models -> EF -> DBContext Class and POCO class

9. In a controller folder, add new API controller with EF 
		in the models - choose the name of your class - mapped to table in database
		in the context - choose the DBContext class that got generated during step 7

10. you get a new contoller file, it used Dependency injection by default, which we should use but we have not studied DI yet

11. Remove the constructor from Controller file

12. Instantiate the new object of DBContext class

13. Build the application, run the application

14. Perform all the crud operations and for all the operations, database will be updated

15. add a new table customers with some records

	

create table Customers
(
	cId int primary key,
	cName varchar(20),
	cCategory varchar(20),
	cLocation varchar(20),
	cWallet int,
	cIsActive bit)

insert into Customers values(501, 'Nikhil','Regular','Mumbai',5000,1)

16. go back to Visual studio --> tools -> Nuget package manager -> package manager console

	fire the same command with -Force parameter

	Scaffold-DbContext "server=WIN8\NIKHILINSTANCE; database=shoppingAPIDB;integrated security=true" -OutputDir Models\EF -Provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -Force

17. check the Models->EF Folder- it will add a new class Customers.cs

18. create a new API controller with EF and follow same process like you did for Products (step 9 to 14)

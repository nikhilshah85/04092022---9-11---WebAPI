ASP.net webapi with
	EF Core 
	DI - Dependency Injection
	Repository Pattern
	How to consume WebAPI In front end (ASP.Net MVC, Angular, React, Java etc...)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	DI - is a framework feature this days with all the technologies

	As a developer we create a lot of Objects using new Keyword, a real world object has lots of resources
	
	For A Web APP
		We do not write any code to destroy the object (Most of developers)
		in a web app, object keeps getting created for every new request on server
		server memory keeps getting full and thus affects the performance after somedays days

	----Instead from now on, 
			Objects will be created by framework on demand and will be inject in request / response pipeline
			Object will be destroyed by framework once request is processed

		It also gives us an ability to decided when object should be destroyed
